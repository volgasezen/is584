In this lab we will clean and process tweets with the hashtag #COVID19. Processing will involve tokenization, lemmatization, handling negations and more. We will then analyze the sentiment of each processed tweet with a rule based model.

Extra content that won't be covered live include regular expressions, part-of-speech tagging, levenshtein (edit) distance and Turkish NLP with Zeyrek Python package.
